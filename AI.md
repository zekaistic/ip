# Record of use of AI tools

*18/09/25*\
Used Cursor AI to add additional JUnit tests, on top of the ones I already made. It modified/added the following files:
1. ChungusTest.java
2. DeadlineTest.java
3. EventTest.java
4. PriorityTest.java
5. TaskListTest.java
6. TaskStatusTest.java
7. TaskTest.java
8. TodoTest.java
9. ParserTest.java

The tool really helped to add substantial tests that had value in testing my chatbot. It saved me alot of time in ensuring my code was tested extensively.
